Recursion : solve(n) : print 1 to n

Base condition : smallest valid/invalid input and result in that condition

Hypothesis : it assumes the method will hold true and replicate the behaviour for all the valid input space.

Induction : code which ensures our hypothesis hold trues always


**4 approaches to solve the recursion problem :**
1. create the recursive tree - IP/Op method (decision + choice)
2. Base condition | hypothesis | Induction
3. choice diagram (DP)
